CSE293: Chisel Neural Net
=======================

Contributors: Reese Levine, Chris Liu

Project Summary
======================
This project implements a neural net in hardware as a collection of neurons and layers. The goal is to develop several
different layers and a way to combine them into a complete net for training and prediction.


Project Tasks
====================
Initial project setup: done
Fully connected layer initialization and forward propagation (and initial tests): done
Fully connected layer backpropagation: incomplete
Neural net, with parameterized layers: incomplete
Activation layer: incomplete
Convolutional layer: incomplete

Possible optimizations
===================
Hardware sharing across subsequent layers
More cycles to compute matrix operations
